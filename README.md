# Elden Ring Armor Optimization
Finding the optimal armor set combinations in Elden Ring using multi-criteria optimization with various goals:

## Motivation
My goal in this study was to answer a question never before mathematically solved: What are the truly best/most optimal armor combinations in Elden Ring?
Elden Ring, the 2022 "Game of the Year" winner, alongside its 2024 expansion "Shadow of the Erdtree," has 708 different armor pieces. Most armor in the game is collected in sets of 4 pieces (corresponding to the 4 slots: Helm, Chest, Gauntlets, Legs).
However, there are no set bonuses and no inherent advantages to keeping sets 'together.' This undermines past community efforts for determing the best armor, as they have almost always solely considered full sets.
Using data orignally compiled by eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com of armor attributes viewable in game, I set out to find Elden Ring's best possible armor combinations.
